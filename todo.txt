In the case of attaching a face element which requires the bulk dof types to 
be classified differently, it can be done either by the bulk element, 
or by the  face element. [describe how the bulk classification works, 
including the return of the ndof_types()]. 

State that the bulk element classification approach does not work when a 
boundary has two different type of face elements on it. What will it classify 
the bulk DOF as? surface 1 or surface mesh 2? Can overcome this by having the 
surface mesh RE-CLASSIFY the bulk DOFs. Include pictures like the prescribed 
lagrange tutorial

*******************************************************************************

Under-the-hood, describe how the dof_to_dof_map is handled (gets converted to 
other dof to block map within the preconditioner's block setup, and how the 
dof_to_block_map passed to the block_setup function is not ignored, but the 
identity is still used. Compare this with the case where no precomputed 
blocks are used.)

*******************************************************************************

Under the hood: Talk about how get_block and get_block_vector works, in the 
case where there are no precomputed preconditioner blocks, the case where there
are blocks precomputed (why is this necessary), and the related functions 
(i.e. we store the precomputed block distributions, etc...)

*******************************************************************************

Make more explicit that the meshes have nothing to do with blocks. Meshes are
a method of distinguishing the elemental DOF types into preconditioner DOF
types.
  * get_dof_number_for_unknowns(...) determines the classification of the dof
    and the ordering of the elemental DOF types.
  * mesh order determines the ordering of the preconditioner DOF types from the
    elemental DOF types.

*******************************************************************************

Highlight the differences between the simple block preconditioner and the 
generalised one. Give a reference to the generalised block preconditioner
documentation.
